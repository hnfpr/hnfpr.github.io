*"In the silence between creation and destruction lies the space where ideas are born."*

### **Whoami?**

Hello. I’m Putra 👋 — a designer first—a creator of interfaces, experiences, and visual languages. But beneath the surface, I am also a tinkerer, coder, and explorer of the abstract. My work oscillates between these worlds: designing for humans while decoding the language of machines.

Lately, I’ve been drawn to the enigmatic allure of **artificial intelligence**—its potential to amplify human creativity, its capacity for both brilliance and absurdity, and its eerie resemblance to the subconscious mind. I see AI not as a tool but as a collaborator, a mirror reflecting our own ambitions and fears.

 **What You’ll Find Here**

- 🎨 **Design**: Crafting visuals that speak louder than words.
- 💻 **Code**: Exploring the boundaries of what can be built (and broken).
- 🤖 **AI & Technology**: Venturing into the unknown realms of machine learning, neural networks, and generative systems.
- 🌱 **Personal Growth**: Documenting my journey through self-discovery, productivity, and resilience.

This isn’t just a blog; it’s a record of my descent into the void of creation—where beauty emerges from uncertainty, and meaning is forged in the act of making.

### **Current Obsessions**

At this moment, I find myself consumed by:
- Experimenting with **generative AI tools**, probing their limits and uncovering new ways to merge art and technology.
- Learning the intricacies of software development, one bug at a time.
- Reflecting on the intersection of design, philosophy, and existentialism—because creating something meaningful requires confronting the void within.

### **Why Share This?**

To create is to confront the abyss—to stare into the infinite possibilities of form and function and dare to shape them into something tangible. By sharing my process, experiments, and failures here, I hope to inspire others to embrace their own creative struggles.

If you resonate with this ethos—or if you simply enjoy watching someone wrestle with the complexities of design, code, and AI—you’re welcome to join me on this journey.

*"Creation is an act of defiance against entropy—a fleeting attempt to impose order upon chaos. And yet, it is in this defiance that we find purpose."*
