Let’s keep it real: I’ve always been the “indoor type.” Give me a good book, a sketchpad, and a cozy blanket, and I’m set for hours. But lately, my body started staging protests. The “Bali belly” (you know, that stubborn pooch from too many desk snacks and Netflix nights) was getting loud . Plus, I’d get winded walking up stairs. Not cute.

So, I did what any self-respecting introvert would do: I panicked, then Googled “how to not feel like a couch potato.” Turns out, the answer was simpler than I thought—move more, but like, barely .

**My “Why Bother” Moment**

I’m not gonna lie: the idea of working out felt as appealing as a root canal. But I missed feeling good . My brain was sharp from all the reading, but my body felt like it was stuck in molasses. I needed a hobby that didn’t involve sitting. Enter: 15 minutes a day .

**The “Meh, Let’s Try This” Experiment**

I downloaded Freelatics on a whim. No gym membership, no pricey equipment—just my living room floor and a vague sense of hope. The app had these quick, no-nonsense workouts. Some days it was yoga flows; others, it was jumping jacks and squats. At first, I rolled my eyes. 15 minutes? What’s that gonna do?

***Spoiler alert:*** It totally did.

**The (Small But Mighty) Wins**

**Bali belly? Bye.** 
Moving daily helped my digestion chill out. No more “food baby” after lunch.

**Energy boost** 
I stopped needing a nap after my third coffee. My brain felt clearer, too.

**No guilt, all wins** 
Some days I only did 10 minutes. And you know what? It still counted.

**Why Freelatics Didn’t Suck**

The app didn’t make me feel like a fitness failure. The trainers were hype but not too extra, and the routines were short enough to not make me rage-quit. Plus, the progress tracker gave me dopamine hits without the pressure.

**Your Turn (No, Really)**

If you’re eyeing your dusty yoga mat like it’s a chore, here’s my advice:

**Start laughably small.** 
10 minutes. 5. Heck, do 1 minute of jumping jacks. Just start .

**Pick something fun.** 
Hate running? Dance. Hate dancing? Try yoga. Hate everything? Walk.

**Use what’s free.**
YouTube, TikTok workouts, or apps like Freelatics. No excuses.

**Final Thoughts (No Lecture, Promise)**

I’m still a book-loving, art-making homebody. But now, I’m also the person who looks forward to sweating. Crazy, right? It’s not about becoming a gym rat—it’s about feeling strong enough to enjoy the hobbies you already love.

So, grab a water bottle, hit play on that 15-minute workout, and let’s do the bare minimum together. Trust me, your future self will high-five you.

*P.S. Those 15 minutes? They’re now my daily “me time.” And yes, I still read in the bath afterward. Balance, baby.* 💪📚

*TL;DR:* Stop overthinking it. Move a little. Repeat. 😎
