Life got away from me. For years, I was just&hellip; surviving. Work drained me, parenthood overwhelmed me, and somewhere in all the chaos, I stopped dreaming. I told myself it was fine—that I didn’t have time or energy for anything else. But deep down? I knew I was lying to myself.
I wasted so much time doing nothing meaningful. Scrolling through my phone, watching dumb shows, avoiding anything that felt hard or scary. And now, here I am at 28, staring at this gaping hole where passions and goals used to be. It’s suffocating sometimes—the thought that I let life pass me by while everyone else seemed to figure theirs out." />

<p>Life got away from me. For years, I was just&hellip; surviving. Work drained me, parenthood overwhelmed me, and somewhere in all the chaos, I stopped dreaming. I told myself it was fine—that I didn’t have time or energy for anything else. But deep down? I knew I was lying to myself.</p>
<p>I wasted so much time doing nothing meaningful. Scrolling through my phone, watching dumb shows, avoiding anything that felt hard or scary. And now, here I am at 28, staring at this gaping hole where passions and goals used to be. It’s suffocating sometimes—the thought that I let life pass me by while everyone else seemed to figure theirs out.</p>
<p>Then, almost accidentally, I stumbled into AI design. Coding. Something completely foreign. At first, it felt impossible—like trying to climb a mountain with no gear. Every tutorial left me feeling dumber than the last. Who was I kidding? Starting something new at my age feels laughable most days.</p>
<p>But there’s this tiny part of me that won’t let go. Maybe because it’s the first thing in years that actually makes me feel alive again. Even if it’s frustrating. Even if I suck at it. There’s something about building something from scratch—even if it’s just lines of code—that reminds me I’m capable of more than I’ve been telling myself.</p>

<p>It doesn’t fix everything, though. Some nights, I still lie awake wondering why I waited so long, why I gave up on myself for years. Anxiety creeps in, whispering that I’ll never catch up, that I’m too late. And yeah, maybe I am behind. But starting small is better than not starting at all, right?</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;So here I am. Fumbling through tutorials, making mistakes, and hoping against hope that it’s not too late to turn things around.&rdquo;</em></p>
