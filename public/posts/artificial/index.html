<h3 id="stepping-stones-to-the-unknown">Stepping Stones to the Unknown</h3>
<p>One month ago, I stepped into the labyrinth. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning were these towering concepts I didn’t fully understand, like puzzles too complex to solve. At first, every line of code felt clumsy, every tutorial left me more confused than before. It was overwhelming, almost paralyzing. Who was I kidding? This wasn’t my world.</p>
<p>But then, something shifted. Maybe it was stubbornness or just sheer curiosity, but I kept going. DataCamp became my guide—a map through the chaos. Slowly, pieces started falling into place. Neural networks began to make sense. Models trained. Patterns emerged from randomness. For the first time in years, I felt… alive. Like I was building something real, even if it was small.</p>
<p>It’s not easy. Some nights, doubt creeps in, whispering that I’m too late, too slow, too out of place. But when I see a model work—or even when it fails—I remember why I started. There’s beauty in the struggle, in reaching for something beyond myself.</p>
<p>So I keep moving forward. One dataset at a time, one step deeper into the unknown. The path ahead is unclear, but that’s okay. What matters is that I’m still walking it.</p>
