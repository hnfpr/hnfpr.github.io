      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;episode-1-first-impact-the-beginning&#34;&gt;Episode 1: First Impact &amp;ldquo;The Beginning&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Life got away from me. For years, I was just&amp;hellip; surviving. Work drained me, parenthood overwhelmed me, and somewhere in all the chaos, I stopped dreaming. I told myself it was fine—that I didn’t have time or energy for anything else. But deep down? I knew I was lying to myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wasted so much time doing nothing meaningful. Scrolling through my phone, watching dumb shows, avoiding anything that felt hard or scary. And now, here I am at 28, staring at this gaping hole where passions and goals used to be. It’s suffocating sometimes—the thought that I let life pass me by while everyone else seemed to figure theirs out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
